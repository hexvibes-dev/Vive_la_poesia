        From my Window<small class="by">~by Elio Torres</small>

      <div>
        <h1 class="text">From My Window</h1>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="text">My window is always open,
and from there I see the unforeseen.<br>
I watch the rain fall, and the sun appear.<br>
I see clouds telling me not to do it again.<br>
I see the man on the corner sipping his coffee—</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="text">then the next day,<br> I see him disappear.<br>
Sometimes I think my window opens
onto another world,<br>
and I wake up and see deeply.<br>
I see a child playing barefoot, unafraid.<br>
Then I see a woman yelling without reason.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="text">She’s suffering—and I see it from my window.<br>
My farmer friend sells his goods
at a steep price.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="text">I don’t know what time he wakes to work,<br>
and who cares if they call him a fool.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="text">I keep watching—I see a doctor in white<br>
heading to work,<br> though it pays him little.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <p class="text">I see a student going to university,<br>
dreams flowing from him without end.<br>
I see a man with rings sitting in a modern car—<br>
I wonder who he is—</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="text">a professional? A businessman?<br>
Or just  neighborhood drifter?<br>
I grow tired of watching<br>
and start to imagine—</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="text">what if it were different?<br>
If I sat in the chair across the way,<br>
and saw things from another perspective,</p>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <p class="text">changing things from the ground up?
I don’t want to go outside—<br>
from my window, I see everything:<br>
from the simple to the complex.<br>
But before stepping out,<br>
you must look in the mirror.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="text">My window is still there.<br>
I’m not sure if I want to look through it.<br>
A TV would be better—<br>
so I could change the channel.<br>
Truth is visible from my window—</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="text">but I want to stand up<br>
and help build another view.<br>
I want to see horses run—without a track.<br>
I ask myself if a better world is possible—<br>
and I remember<br>
“Imagine all the people,”<br>
sung by John Lennon.</p>
